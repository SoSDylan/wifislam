Run locServer.py on herbert.cs.washington.edu for location serving.
  Queries should be of the form:
    http://www.herbert.cs.washington.edu:12345/loc?mac1=-45&mac2=-67?macn=-55

Run "sudo ./wifi.py nope" for trace collecting.
  type "set location Home" to add a location.
  User must later manually create file ./locations/Home.id" with lat and lon.

Run "sudo ./wifi.py localize" to perform localization and trace collection.

You should also download and untar in the wifislam directory:
  http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/jhebert/networks.tgz

If something doesn't work well because I didn't document what should be done,
please email me at jhebert@cs.washington.edu.
